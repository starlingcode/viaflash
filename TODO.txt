- Pop out for adding ratio

Wavetable Set Editor:
! Fix table flashing for modules
- Simultaneous visualizations
- Truncate FFT readout
- Why is FFT for the sine wave of impevens so noisy?
- Minmax filter for number of table filterings (two handle slider is best)

- Augment the buttons for the wavetable modules to help with size management
- Description for wavetables
- Default usage metadata for wavetables

Viafirmware Repo:
