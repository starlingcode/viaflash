- Add titles to resources
- Rework set browser ui with custom Via LED buttons
! Figure out how to live code the UI

Main Window:
- Poll for connected via
- Integerate progress bar into main window
- Progress bars for downloading should be cumulative for all resources
- Title to slug and slug to title conversion to play nice with combo boxes
- Replace firmware info dialog with text description that changes on firmware selection
- Do the same thing with sets ^^
- Local firmware

OSC3 Editor:
- Chord editor really sucks


SYNC3 Editor:
- Better ratio grid, make scrollbar optional
- Description for fill buttons
- Scale description tag
- Sorted unsorted paradigm makes no sense because you cant reorder ratios
- Pop out for adding ratio

Wavetable Set Editor:
! Fix table flashing for modules
- Simultaneous visualizations
- Truncate FFT readout
- Why is FFT for the sine wave of impevens so noisy?
- Minmax filter for number of table filterings (two handle slider is best)
- Redo slope pair/cycle concept as tag system that encompasses that idea, default to all on, add button to clear filter
- Augment the buttons for the wavetable modules to help with size management
- Description for wavetables
- Default usage metadata for wavetables

Viafirmware Repo:
- Wavetables need to get filterable tags in general including default usage
- Wavetables need a wizard to create titles and generally edit remote resources
