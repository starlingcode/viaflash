! Oh my god the structure of this is a fucking mess

- Drag needs a ui explanation, would be good to have a drag button and a remove button that's just an x
- Vertical margins between widgets in resource editor subsection
- Empty scale
- Fix vcvrack save 
- Resource editor close event fucked up
- Fix Combo box population after new scale set saved
- Margin of button misses hit test for mouse for gateseq buttons
- Remove drum envemlope from comb
- Minimax slider is missing labels in hubuntu
- browser gets screwey with a list index out of range
- Wavetable browser preset name is goofy
- Sync layout changes with the text wrapping for the sorting 
- Change the button diabled paradigm


OSC3:
- I don't know where the chord data for unquanitized comes from exactly, is it just mode 2

App:
No borders around radio buttons
- Mac, Windows, and Linux builds
- Documentation/tooltips?
(Annoying Bug) Theres sometimes an exception when you close an editor and select a new module, trying to stop timer from another thread?
(Not Strictly Necessary) Shorthand for Default resources? Should default be a metadata item?

SYNC3 Editor:
!!! Sync3 restore unsorted order is all fucked up, it doesn't take into account adding or removing ratios in the sorted state
 - Really, to fix this we need to do the same thing to GATESEQ, we need to have the "sort" operation act on top of an unsorted list and do all add/remove/reorder operations to that unsorted list at the level of the data structure.
- Sync3 ratio widget needs remove button

Main window:
- Local firmware
!!! Dealing with the menu on window close is awkwarddd

Viafirmware Repo:
- Add real descriptions to wavetables
- Add real titles to wavetables

Table editor:
(Annoying Bug) Why does the browser have those weird lines
(Biggish Project) Meta drum envelope handling, add an accent feature here!
(Reach) Scanner preview
