Resource descriptions (needs work in viafirmware):
	- Gateseq

General app things:
- Theres sometimes an exception when you close an editor and select a new module, trying to stop timer from another thread?

! Fix table flashing for modules
	- Augment the buttons for the wavetable modules to help with size management
- Why does the browser have those weird lines
- Description for wavetables
* Redo filtering
	- Minmax filter for number of table filterings (two handle slider is best)
	- Redo slope pair/cycle concept as tag system that encompasses that idea, default to all on, add button to clear filter. Tags get collected and added to view by editor.
- Meta drum envelope handling, add an accent feature here!
- Scanner preview

SYNC3 Editor:
- Filter open dialog for scala suffix on import to correct extension
- Can we make the margins a little lower for the ratio list

- Quantization descriptions?
- Add more quantizations to stock from the start

GATESEQ Editor:

Viafirmware Repo:

- Wavetables need to get filterable tags in general including default usage
- Wavetables need a wizard to create titles and generally edit remote resources
- Add real titles to wavetables
