Table editor:
! Fix table flashing for modules
- How about a 3d FFT plot eh?
- Truncate FFT readout
- Why is FFT for the sine wave of impevens so noisy?
- Minmax filter for number of table filterings (two handle slider is best)
- Redo slope pair/cycle concept as tag system that encompasses that idea, default to all on, add button to clear filter
- Augment the buttons for the wavetable modules to help with size management
- Description for wavetables
- Default usage metadata for wavetables

Main window:
- Fix Default Mode 2 title in sync3 scales in viafirmware
- Progress bar covers up percentage complete text (this might be fucked to fix)
- Poll for connected via (probably not but lets keep it on)
- Local firmware

App utilities:
- Add descriptions to save logic (i think this means like be able to enter description/title when saving a resource)

OSC3 Editor:
- Chord editor really sucks
- Quantization descriptions?

GATESEQ Editor:
- Pattern entry paradigm is lameeeeee, consider something similar to SYNC3
- Pattern descriptions

Viafirmware Repo:
- Wavetables need to get filterable tags in general including default usage
- Wavetables need a wizard to create titles and generally edit remote resources
- Wavetable descriptions
- Add real titles to wavetables
